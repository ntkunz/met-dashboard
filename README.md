Do you want to see a different piece of art from the Met collection s your homepage? Look no further! 

Essentially, I love the [Momentum Dashboard](https://momentumdash.com/), but wanted to make it more inspiring, something other than digital landscape photographs.

The first MVP will be a simple splash dashboard displaying a piece of art and some information about it. I know it can become more useful with time. If you'd like to add a feature, please clone the repository and make a pull request with your new feature. 

If there's something you'd like someone else to add, open an issue in the repo. 

This app was made with [vite-react-ts](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts).
